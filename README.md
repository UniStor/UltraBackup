# UltraBackup
Backup Any Data, Anywhere, to Any Cloud! A more memorable rebrand of Uni.os/Stor App with a subset of features and simple UI. Designed to backup every node on your Personal Area Networks! And setup storage clusters (UniCloud.Local). Backup your Desktop or Laptop using a PXE boot image, and monitor progress on your phone.

# Inspire.
List of software which we took inspiration from: Not all features are developed in UltraBackup - some may be borrowed/imported from full Uni.os software suite, like App snapshotting. See: https://github.com/Unicorn-os https://github.com/Uni-Apps for development.

# Revenue?
**If it's Free & Open-Source (GPL) How do we support the project?**
## UniCoin - A Thriving & *Safe* Cryptocurrency Ecosystem
We make money by refering people to to products using our cryptocurrency ecosystem: Storage smart contracts are traded on UniExchange which we own and take market-maker **Bid/Ask Spread** - this is our primary revenue source.

## Storage Smart-Contracts
We recommend UniStor for short term storage, and [EternalFS - Global Immutable File store](https://github.com/EternalFS) managed by an Endowment  for long term "memories" perservation & Archiving, potentially their Life's most important memories. But UltraBackup is pluggable & had a modules/extensions framwork so you can use any cloud storage provider you like.

## Part of a Whole: Symbiotic A.I.
We also want people to try out Uni.Key for security, LifeGraph for organization, & Symbiotic.AI for full suite of A.I. helper tools - which all requires decentralized cloud to offer their full capabilities.

## Market. eCommerce revenue
Finally:
- We have a DAO & decentralized community of hardware enthusiasts who Test & Sell Refurbished Hard drives & Tape Storage using industry best practaces & list them for sale on: https://Market.UniSocial.net/Hw/Storage eCommerse store. This is a traditional retail business model. 
- We can make affiliate commissions on other retailers: like NewEgg.com, Amazon, Ebay selling similar storage Hardware products.
