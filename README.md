# UltraBackup
Backup Any Data, Anywhere, to Any Cloud! A more memorable rebrand of Uni.os/Stor App with a subset of features and simple UI. Designed to backup every node on your Personal Area Networks! And setup storage clusters (UniCloud.Local). Backup your Desktop or Laptop using a PXE boot image, and monitor progress on your phone.

# Inspire.
List of software which we took inspiration from: Not all features are developed in UltraBackup - some may be borrowed/imported from full Uni.os software suite, like App snapshotting. See: https://github.com/Unicorn-os https://github.com/Uni-Apps for development.
